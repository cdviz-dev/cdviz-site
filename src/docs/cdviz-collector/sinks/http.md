# HTTP Sink

Forwards CDEvents to an external HTTP endpoint via POST request. Use for webhooks, external APIs, notification services, and any HTTP-based system that accepts JSON events.

## Configuration

```toml
[sinks.webhook]
enabled = true
type = "http"
destination = "https://example.com/webhook"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter                    | Type     | Default                     | Description                                                                                                                            |

## Request Format

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Body**: Complete CDEvent serialized as JSON
- **Errors**: Failed requests (HTTP 3xx+ or network errors) are logged; processing continues

## Redirects

Redirects are followed, but configured `headers` (tokens, API keys, signatures) are **dropped on a cross-origin redirect** so credentials never leak to another server. To keep them for a known host (e.g. an API redirecting to its own CDN), allowlist it:

```toml
[sinks.webhook]
trusted_redirect_hosts = ["*.example.com"]
```

An `https` → `http` downgrade is never trusted.

## Authentication

### Bearer token

```toml
[sinks.webhook.headers]
"authorization" = { type = "secret", value = "Bearer your-api-token" }
```

### API key (secret value)

Keep the secret out of the config file. Use the `_file` suffix to read it from a mounted file:

```toml
[sinks.webhook.headers]
"x-api-key" = { type = "secret", value_file = "/run/secrets/api_key" }
```

Or set it at runtime. Keep the hyphens in header names (see [Configuration: Environment Variables](../configuration.md#environment-variables)):

```bash
# Preferred: --set flag handles hyphens cleanly
cdviz-collector connect --config config.toml \
  --set 'sinks.webhook.headers."x-api-key".value = "actual-api-key"'

# Or via env wrapper (bash cannot export names with hyphens directly):
env 'CDVIZ_COLLECTOR__SINKS__WEBHOOK__HEADERS__X-API-KEY__VALUE=actual-api-key' \
  cdviz-collector connect --config config.toml
```

Kubernetes `env[].name` and GitHub Actions `env:` support hyphens natively.

### HMAC signature (for webhook receivers that verify signatures)

```toml
[sinks.webhook.headers]
"x-hub-signature-256" = { type = "signature", token_file = "/run/secrets/hmac_secret", signature_prefix = "sha256=", signature_on = "body", signature_encoding = "hex" }
```

## Transformers <Badge type="warning" text="beta" />

The HTTP sink accepts `transformer_refs`: a chain of [transformers](../transformers.md) applied to events just before this sink sends them, without affecting other sinks. Two main uses:

- **Filter** which events are sent: a transformer that outputs an empty list (`[]`) drops the event for this sink only
- **Reshape** the body into the JSON the destination expects. The output does not have to be a CDEvent

Reshaping lets the destination consume the payload as-is, and can replace an intermediate service whose only job is translating events 1-to-1 into another system's API call. For example, instead of routing through an Argo Workflows template that only converts the event into a GitHub `repository_dispatch` call, a sink transformer can build that payload and the sink posts it to the GitHub API directly:

```toml
[sinks.github_dispatch]
enabled = true
type = "http"
destination = "https://api.github.com/repos/my-org/my-repo/dispatches"
transformer_refs = ["service_deployed_to_dispatch"]

[sinks.github_dispatch.headers]
"authorization" = { type = "secret", value = "Bearer GITHUB_TOKEN" }
"accept" = { type = "static", value = "application/vnd.github+json" }

[transformers.service_deployed_to_dispatch]
type = "vrl"
template = '''
if !contains(string!(.body.context.type), "service.deployed") {
    []  # drop: this sink only reacts to deployments
} else {
    .body = {
        "event_type": "test-deployed-service",
        "client_payload": {
            "artifactId": .body.subject.content.artifactId,
            "environment": .body.subject.content.environment.id,
        },
    }
    [.]
}
'''
```

## Common Use Cases

```toml
# Slack notification on deployment
[sinks.slack]
enabled = true
type = "http"
destination = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00/B00/XXX"

# Forward to authenticated internal API
[sinks.internal_api]
enabled = true
type = "http"
destination = "https://platform.company.com/api/events"

[sinks.internal_api.headers]
"authorization" = { type = "secret", value = "Bearer PLATFORM_API_TOKEN" }

# Fan-out: multiple HTTP sinks all receive every event
[sinks.backup_receiver]
enabled = true
type = "http"
destination = "https://backup-collector.company.com/webhook/events"
```

## Error Handling

Transient failures (network errors, timeouts, 5xx) are retried with exponential backoff for up to `total_duration_of_retries`. Once the budget is exhausted, or on a non-retryable response, the failure is logged and processing continues. The event is not stored for later. For guaranteed delivery, use the [Kafka sink](./kafka.md) or [NATS sink](./nats.md) with a durable consumer.
